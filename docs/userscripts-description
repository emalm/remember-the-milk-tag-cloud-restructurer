Summary:
A script to restructure the tag cloud in Remember the Milk. Based off of masnare's Tag Cloud Colorizer script, jgallen23's RememberTheMilkEnhanced script, and ideas in the Tag Cloud post in the RTM forums.


Description:

<h1>Overview</h1>

Based on masnare's Tag Cloud Colorizer script  (<a href = "http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/25046">http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/25046</a>) and jgallen23's RememberTheMilkEnhanced (<a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/26057">http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/26057</a>), as well as ideas from the Tag Cloud post in the Remember the Milk forums (<a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/forums/tips/2943/">http://www.rememberthemilk.com/forums/tips/2943/</a>).

This script provides a fairly general framework for restructuring the tag cloud in Remember the Milk. Specifically, one can:
<ul>
  <li>Group related lists, locations, and tags by prefix</li>
  <li>Generate a hierarchy of tags dynamically, to arbitrary depth</li>
  <li>Highlight a single tag in its own section</li>
  <li>Rename individual tags anywhere in the tag cloud (ex: P to Personal)</li>
  <li>Recolor tag sections</li>
  <li>Reorder sections arbitrarily</li>
  <li>Hide ordinary list tabs</li>
</ul>

Full details of the section types are given below, in 'Section Types and Preferences'.

The script also includes some stylistic tweaks, such as removing the cow graphic from the RTM page and fixing the sidebar at the top of the page (which becomes crucial if the tag cloud is long). These can easily be commented out if they are not desired.

The hierarchy-style section in particular makes it easy to have projects with subprojects, as these can be stored in their own individual lists. This also reduces the tagging and list redundancy, as long as the user is willing to partition their tasks between project lists.

The default configuration is based on one for my personal use, and it is likely that other users will need to adjust the configuration for their own needs. Changes should be made to the Configuration section in the script, at the top of the Tag Cloud Restructurer section.

If users are familiar with masnare's script, this script differs from it in several ways:
<ul>
  <li>masnare's sections are now the sectionFlat objects.</li>
  <li>No additional "system" tags (such as @__context) are needed, as the header tags are created by the script itself.</li>
  <li>There is now a dictionary-based system for global and per-section preferences.</li>
</ul>
So far, as of April 2012, this script has been tested under Firefox 11 + Greasemonkey and under Google Chrome 18 with the built-in userscript support. I would appreciate feedback and testing on other browsers. Also, any feature requests or suggestions more generally are appreciated, although I am by no means an experienced JavaScript programmer.

<h1>Example Tag Cloud with Tags, Lists, and Locations</h1>

Here is an example tag cloud, corresponding to the default settings in the script: 

<a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=2m7b2q1" target="_blank"><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/2m7b2q1.jpg" border="0" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a>

And here are the active lists, locations, and tags that generate it:

Ordinary Lists:
<ul>
  <li>Inbox</li>
  <li>-P</li>
  <li>-P/Apartment</li>
  <li>-P/Apartment/Cleaning</li>
  <li>-P/Apartment/Repairs</li>
  <li>-P/Computer</li>
  <li>-P/Computer/iPad</li>
  <li>-P/Computer/iPhone</li>
  <li>-P/Computer/OSX</li>
  <li>-P/Computer/RTM Tag Cloud</li>
  <li>-P/Computer/TeX</li>
  <li>-P/Maintenance</li>
  <li>-P/Maintenance/Health</li>
  <li>-P/Maintenance/Vehicles</li>
  <li>-P/Recreation</li>
  <li>-P/Recreation/Games</li>
  <li>-P/Recreation/Music</li>
  <li>-P/Recreation/Reading</li>
  <li>-W</li>
  <li>-W/Reports</li>
  <li>-W/Reports/Quarterly</li>
  <li>-W/Reports/TPS</li>
  <li>Lent/Borrowed</li>
  <li>Sent</li>
</ul>

Tags (each of which is associated to at least one active task, so that it is displayed in the cloud):
<ul>
  <li>@email</li> 
  <li>@errand</li>
  <li>@phone</li>
  <li>_chores</li>
  <li>financial</li> 
  <li>gifts</li>
  <li>goal</li>
  <li>maybe</li>
  <li>next</li>
</ul>

Locations (as with tags, associated to at least one active task):
<ul>
  <li>@home</li>
  <li>@office</li>
</ul>

<h1>Section Types and Preferences</h1>

<h2><code>sectionSingle</code></h2>

The <code>sectionSingle</code> section matches a single tag in the cloud and renames it.

<h2><code>sectionFlat</code></h2>

The <code>sectionSingle</code> section groups all tags starting with the specified prefix together in a single section, prefaced by the specified header text. The tags can be displayed run-in, as in the Contexts section, or as a block, as in the Miscellaneous section.

<h2><code>sectionHierarchy</code></h2>



<h2>General Preferences</h2>



<h1>Changes in Version 1.1</h1>
