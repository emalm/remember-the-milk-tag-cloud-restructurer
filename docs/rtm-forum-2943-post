I've been using my own variation on masnare's <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/25046">Tag Cloud Colorizer script</a> since mid-2008, and I've finally gotten around to cleaning it up and posting it at <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/57544">http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/57544</a>. It's called Remember the Milk: Tag Cloud Restructurer, and here's my tag cloud when running it:

<a href="http://tinypic.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://i32.tinypic.com/10xy6p4.jpg" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a>

The list, location, and tag names that generate it are located in the description on the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/57544">userscripts.org page</a>, so for the sake of brevity I won't duplicate them here.

The major ideas behind the restructuring are the same as in masnare's script, but the script now includes some additional functionality, as well as some administrative differences. Specifically, one can:
* Group related lists, locations, and tags by prefix (as in the original script)
* Rename individual tags
* Generate a hierarchy of tags dynamically, to arbitrary depth
* Rename individual tags in the hierarchy (ex: P to Personal)
* Recolor tag sections
* Reorder sections after processing
* Hide ordinary list tabs (since they're already in the tag cloud anyway)
I've also included code adapted from the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/26057">RememberTheMilkEnhanced script</a> to hide the cow, to adjust the status bar position accordingly. The code to hide the ordinary list tabs is also from that script.

If you're used to masnare's script, the key differences are as follows:
* The original sections are now the sectionFlat objects.
* No additional "system" tags (such as @__context) are needed, as the header tags are created by the script itself.
* There is now a dictionary-based system for global and per-section preferences.
These changes should help eliminate some of the redundancies I encountered when first using the original script, since there's no longer a need for special organizational tags for the flat-section headers, nor special system tasks to host the tags. The presentation options in the original script are still mostly there, although they have largely been renamed and reorganized.

This is my first real experience with JavaScript, so I'd definitely appreciate any feedback, including bug reports, suggestions, and feature requests. I've also tested this only on Firefox 3.5.* with Greasemonkey, so if it breaks under older Firefoxes or under Opera (or even under others' installations of Firefox 3.5.*), that would be good for me to know.

@masnare: Thanks very much for your original script! It's been a genuine pleasure to work with it.
