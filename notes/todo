TODO:
* at some point, process renameTags dict to make keys lowercase (so they match RTM tags)
 - check that it correctly lower-cases unicode chars (could be in list names)

* move [[...]] processing to initial tag processing
 - move into rename_text block
 - should override renameTags dict

* refactor code in big routines

* verify leaf processing in hierarchy
 - not packed into div correctly? div discarded?

* runin display option for flat sections:
 - true: HEADER: tag tag tag with hanging indent (as in end stages of hierarchy)
 - false (default): HEADER\n block of tags

* idea: specify a list of tags corresponding to smart searches?
 - tag name, smart search string
 - script would create the tag, insert into list to process
 (way to specify smart lists in tag cloud)

* any way to specify two scripts that interact?
 - split config settings into one file, rewriting code in another
 - have code script load config script? or JSON file?
 - hard to host on userscripts.org?

* cleanup:
 - access HTML attributes with properties, not get/setAttribute
 - look for missing vars - esp in loops
 - spacing around operators
 - tabs vs spaces - clean up

* testing:
 - add more comprehensive testing of options to unittest

Documentation:
- create specific example sections
 - enough to illustrate key features
- documents about allowed special characters, unicode, how to put into script
 - suggestions for good characters (esp for Mac/iPhone)
- extensive documentation on personal website (once revised)
