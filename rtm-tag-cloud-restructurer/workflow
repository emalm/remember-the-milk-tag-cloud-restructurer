Workflow:
* Make changes in rtm_tcr_unittest.user.js
 - test in rtm.tcr.unittest account; mainly in Chrome, then in Firefox, Safari

Chrome script iteration:
 - copy to (on freya) ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/leaegfagppffnlnfjambidbohijokkbe/1.0_0/script.js
  - or open file:///Users/emalm/Documents/projects/program/rtm-js/rtm-tag-cloud-restructurer/rtm_tcr_unittest.user.js in Chrome
   - Q: what happens when script already present? overwrites?
 - disable, reenable extension; reload RTM page

Firefox:

Safari:


* Diff rtm_tcr_unittest.user.js to rtm_tcr.user.js
diff command: diff -u rtm_tcr_unittest.user.js rtm_tcr.user.js > rtm_tcr_unittest_to_general.diff
patch command: patch -u -i rtm_tcr_unittest_to_general.diff rtm_tcr_unittest.user.js -o rtm_tcr.user.js

 - modify diff so changes only Greasemonkey context, section dictionary

* Diff rtm_tcr.user.js to rtm_tcr_emalminator.user.js
diff command: diff -u rtm_tcr.user.js rtm_tcr_emalminator.user.js > rtm_tcr_general_to_em.diff
patch command: patch -u -i rtm_tcr_general_to_em.diff rtm_tcr.user.js -o rtm_tcr_emalminator.user.js
 - maintain diff so changes only Greasemonkey context, section dictionary (if necessary)
 - test on personal account
